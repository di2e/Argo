  ** Resolving internal and external addresses **
  
  The IP addresses in the configuration may not want to be hardcoded and may
  only be known at runtime.  The configuration allows you to provide some
  IP address resolvers that will resolve to an actual run-time IP address and
  can be used as a replacement variable (e.g. ${internalIP}) in other configuration
  values.
  
  Items with the "resolve" tag special items that will follow special rules
  to resolve to an IP address.  The name attribute of the tag is how you will reference
  the resolved value in the rest of the configuration file.
  
  For example:
  
  <resolve name="internalIP">ni:eth0:ipv4</resolve>
  will resolve to the ipv4 address associated with the network interface named eth0.  You
  would then reference that value as ${resolve:internalIP} in the rest of the config.
  
  <resolve name="mylabel">https://api.ipify.org</resolve>
  will resolve to the whatever gets returned from the HTTP GET call to the URL provided.
  In this case, ipify.org will return your external IP address.
  You would then reference that value as ${resolve:mylabel} in the rest of the config.
  
  You can really do whatever you need to create the appropriate interpolation values and the
  sources of those values.
  
  The value of these items can be as follows:
  
  1) a string literal - Example: 192.168.0.1 or dnsname.myorg.org
     The string literal is a direct literal replacement value and is not resolved.  This
     is useful when you know exactly what you want.
     
  2) a network interface name - Example: ni:eth0:ipv4 or ni:localhost:ipv6 
     Specifying a network interface name can be useful when you know which network
     interface device you want to use (e.g. eth0, en0, wlan0, etc) and want this value
     parameterized and consistent across VMs that may operate in a cluster and will
     get a dynamic IP address (and you don't want to manually configure each VM instance
     by hand)  The format is as follow:
     
       ni:( available interface name | "localhost" ):("ipv4" | "ipv6" | <blank>)
       
       The ipv4 or ipv6 on the end is optional and default to ipv6
     
     Examples:  
       ni:localhost:ipv4 or ni:localhost - this will resolve to the actual IP address of
         whatever network interface is associated with the "localhost" address.
         
       ni:eth0:ipv6 - this will resolve to the IPV6 IP address (assuming there is one)
       associated with the network interfaces named "eth0"
       
     NOTE:
       Be careful with these values.  If they don't resolve (meaning that the 
       interpolation value is the same as the string you specified) it doesn't mean
       that things are broken.  If a specified interface name doens't exist, then it 
       won't resolve (check the logs and check ifconfig in linux or ipconfig in Windows).
       If the specified interface name exists, but doens't have an IP address of the type
       specified (e.g. some interfaces just don't have an IPv6 or IPv4 address) then it 
       won't resolve (check the logs and check ifconfig in linux or ipconfig in Windows).
       
   3) a URL (http or https only) - Example: https://api.ipify.org
      Specifying a URL in the internalIP or externalIP items will resolve to whatever value
      is returned from a GET call to that URL.  This is important as many cloud environments
      make it difficult to get the publicly or external address of a VM.  If you are using
      HTTPS for a site that requires trust or other SSL certificates, the appropriate certs
      and keystores must be configured first.
      
      Examples:
        https://api.ipify.org - this is a well-known and useful URL to resolve public IP
        addresses on NAT networks (like home networks).  However, this will likely be used 
        in conjunction with IP Port forwarding on the router.
        
        http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4 - this is a well-known and useful
        URL to resolve the public IP for EC2 instances in AWS.
        
  ** Basic client setup **

  The *listenerURL* is the URL that is used to start up the embedded HTTP listener.
  This can be an internal address or a publicly available address depending
  on your needs.
  
  By default its value is: http://localhost:4005
  Which means that you'll need to make sure that your firewall
  allows traffic on that port, or whatever port you specify.

  The *respondToURL* is the publicly accessible URL for the listener.  It is the
  address that probe responses will be sent to.
  
  The respondToURL may be different than the listenerURL if there is some NAT
  or other port forwarding that needs to be done through firewalls.
  By default, this value is the same as the listenerURL.
  
  Both the listenerURL and the respondToURL can use the interpolation
  replacement variables defined in the configuration. (e.g. internalIP and externalIP)
  
  Examples:
    internalIP will resolve to the IPV4 address assigned to the interface named eth0
    <resolve name="internalIP">ni:eth0:ipv4</resolve>
    <listenerURL>http://${resolve:internalIP}:12345</listenerURL>
    
    externalIP will resolve to value of the HTTP GET call to the AWS external IP service
    (Note: this will only work on configurations running in a AWS EC2 instance)
    <resolveIP name="externalIP"><http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4/resolveIP>
    <respondToURL>http://${resolveIP:externalIP}:80</respondToURL>
    
  The client configuration does a sanity check on all URLs to make sure that are
  well formed (reachable is another matter ... better check your work).

  ** Other Replacement Resolvers **
  
  Other then the "resolveIP" prefix (e.g. ${resolveIP:internalIP}) there are other prefixes
  you can use to inject values from other contexts.  The following are supported:
  
  Prefix: sys - This prefix marks a variable to be a system property
  Example: ${sys:user.home}
  
  Will search for a system property with the given name and replace the variable by its value.
  This is a very easy means for accessing the values of system properties.
  
  Prefix: env  - Variables can also reference OS-specific environment properties.
  Example: ${env:JAVA_HOME}

  
  ** Other Replacement Variables **
  
  Any other items in the XML file are candidates for replacement.  Only the internalIP
  and externalIP require the "resolve" prefix.  Actually, for example if you used just 
  ${externalIP} you'd get the unresolved value.
  
  So, you can define other items in this config file as replacement vars.
  
  For example if you had an particular property a configuration property that you'd like
  to reuse in the configuration, just add a new element (e.g. <propElem>) and then just
  reference it in other values in the config file
  (e.g. <someValue>The property value is ${propElem}</someValue>
