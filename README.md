# Argo
Real-time service discovery

*What is DI2E Runtime Service Discovery?*
DI2E Runtime Service Discovery is a simple and robust protocol for the discovery and location of services on a wide-area network without the use of a central or federated registry.  The primary use-case is to communicate configuration information – such as IP Address and Port – to service consumers.  This service discovery protocol has been released as an open source project called Argo.  The technology and architecture behind Argo is not novel and has been in common use for decades (such as Bonjour and WS-Discovery).
Argo is extremely easy to use.  To have services your participate in the discovery ecosystem, simply install the Argo Responder according to the instructions and start the Responder.  This takes about 5-6 minutes.  There are no changes required to any code to advertise services.
