# Argo
Runtime service discovery

*"To boldly go where hundreds have gone before!"*

**What is DI2E Runtime Service Discovery?**

The Argo Runtime Service Discovery is a simple and robust protocol for the discovery and location of services on a wide-area network without the use of a central or federated registry.  The primary use-case is to communicate configuration information – such as IP Address and Port – to service consumers.  The technology and architecture behind Argo is not novel and has been in common use for decades (such as Bonjour and WS-Discovery).  Therefore, to go where hundreds have gone before.  There are just so many ways to do this.

Argo is extremely easy to use.  To have services your participate in the discovery ecosystem, simply install the Argo Responder according to the instructions and start the Responder.  This takes about 5-6 minutes.  There are no changes required to any code to advertise services.

**Why another Service Discovery Protocol?**

Sure, there are a pile of them out there.  Why Argo?  Two main reason:

1. Long-range protocol

Argo is meant to be a long-range or Wide Area protocol.  The existing protocols are almost exclusively designed to be used in the local-link network.  Meaning that the discovery probes they use are not meant to traverse and be routed out of the local router.  Argo was intented to be used in militrary networks to enable Network Centric Warfare.  With Argo probes, they can go as far as the multicast plan will allow - perhaps the entire extended network, including mobile ad-hoc mesh networks (MANETS).  However, this only really works when you adminstratively own the entire network.  The US Miltiary does, in fact, adminstratively own their networks.  How convenient for us.

2. Security

Other mainstream protocols such as WS-Discovery and mDNS simply ignore security.  Argo allows a number of mutually allowable and strong security paradigms to be applied to the communcation packets.
