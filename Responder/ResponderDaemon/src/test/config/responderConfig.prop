# Uncomment to enable Argo to discovery mDNS services as well
# You only really need on one mDNS enables Responder for a local network
# If you enable more than one Argo Responder with this plugin, you'll get redundancy at the price of
# multiple answers for a probe.  This is the trade-off with a multicast-unicast (Argo) protocol and a
# multicast-multicast (mDNS) protocol.  Perhaps we can do some link-local leader election in a later
# release.
