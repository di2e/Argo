# Uncomment to enable Argo to discovery mDNS services as well
# You only really need on one mDNS enables Responder for a local network
# If you enable more than one Argo Responder with this plugin, you'll get redundancy at the price of

# multicast-multicast (mDNS) protocol.  Perhaps we can do some link-local leader election in a later
