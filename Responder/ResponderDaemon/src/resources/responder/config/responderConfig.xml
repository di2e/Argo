  <!-- 
  This section describes the configuration for allowing the Responder to HTTPS as a legitimate
  response protocol.  By default, it's false, meaning that any probes that come in with a
  respondTo address that uses the HTTPS scheme will fail.  If you set the allowHTTPS flag to true
  then the Responder will send responses to clients that want to use TLS to protect the answers
  from Responders.  If you set the allowHTTPS flag to true and leave the rest of the parameters
  blank then the client will use the default Java VM trust store.

  <!-- 
  The Responder has a thread pool that is uses to manage the load in inbound probes as they
  get distributed to the probeHandlers.  Each probe gets distributed to each Probe Handler in
  serial for each probe that comes in.  A thread is allocated per probe that comes in over one
  of the transports.
   -->
  <threadPoolSize>10</threadPoolSize>

  <!-- 
  The Responder has the ability to show a status list.  There is no management API for the responder
  at this time.  To see some various stats as to how well the Responder is handling inbound load,
  enable the run monitor to see how the thread pool is working and to see what type of load
  the Responder is handling in messages per second.

  <!-- 
  Probe Handlers are what makes the Responder useful.  They encapsulate the "what now" when a 
  Responder receives a probe over one of the configured transports.  There are several transports
  that Argo comes with OOTB.  They include:
  
    ConfigFile probe handler - this handler looks into a list of services configured from a xml file.
    
  You can have as many probe handlers configured as you like.  You can even have more than one of the
  same type of probe handler configured depending on your needs as long as they have different
  configurations.
    
  There are other OOTB probe handlers called Repeaters.  They are explained a little lower in the file.
  -->
  <probeHandlers>
  
    <!-- 
    The default configuration comes with the ConfigFileProbeHandlerPlugin.  This plugin uses
    a file that contains the list of services that this responder advertises.  This plugin
    also scans for changes to that file while the responder is running, so you can change that
    file, the responder will pick up the changes and then report whatever the new file contents
    provide.  The ConfigFileProbeHandlerPlugin does not read the file each time a probe is handled
    and keeps a memory-resident list of services instead to provide the necessary speed.

    <!-- 
    Uncomment to enable Argo to discovery mDNS services as well.
    
    You only really need one mDNS enabled Responder for a local network.
    If you enable more than one Argo Responder with this plugin, you'll get redundancy at the price of
    multiple answers for a probe.  This is the trade-off with a multicast-unicast (Argo) protocol and a
    multicast-multicast (mDNS) protocol.  Perhaps we can do some link-local leader election in a later
    release.

    <!-- 
    The following configurations are for Repeater Plugins.  These are Probe Handler plugins that will
    repeat incoming probe payloads off to a new transport with a new configuration.  There are two
    OOTB repeater plugins: the MulticastRepeater and the AmazonSNSRepeater.  These are useful when you
    have multiple transports types in your domain or you want to have multiple channels (perhaps at
    different levels of granularity in your organization) that you want to send probes on.
    
    For example, say your enterprise domain uses Amazon SNS to send enterprise wide probes.  But, you
    have a remote installation (on some LAN that's NOT in AWS) that wants to participate in discovery.
    This remote location LAN uses Multicast for its transport.  If you want services to directly 
    respond to probes from the AWS channel, setup a repeater in your LAN that will listen for probes from
    AWS on your enterprise channel and then repeat them to the local network via multicast.  Don't 
    worry about feedback with this setup as the repeating Responder will remember that it "processed"
    that repeated probe and not handle it again.  The other responders inside your LAN listening on the
    Multicast Transport will pick up the probe from AWS as if it was originated within your LAN.  
    
    There are other repeaters and transports located in Github at: https://github.com/argoPlugins

  The list of Transports provides the glue for the Responder to listen for probes
  over the network.  You can have as many Transports as you like and you can also
  have more than one type each with a difference configuration, providing the Transport 
  class allows for that.
  
  For example, if you want to have 2 Multicast Transports listening, each on a different
  multicast group/port, then just list two <transport> entries with the same classname
  but different configuration files.

    <!-- 
    The MulticastTransport is the default.  It should also likely be the transport of
    last resort and all other transports are based on some other centralized pub/sub 
    service.  There is more detail on how to use this transport and when in the documentation.
